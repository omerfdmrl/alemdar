# Alemdar

Alemdar is fast, basic neural network library. It's designed for experimental usages, not recommended to use commercial.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push

- [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
- [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Clone project

    git clone https://github.com/omerfdmrl/alemdar alemdar

Run example network

    cd alemdar
    cp ./examples/main.c ./main.c
    make

End with an example of training of AND gate.

### Usage

You can check `examples/` folder until I wrote doc.
